Project Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository highlights some of the key data science and analytics projects I've worked on, showcasing my expertise in Python, R, and statistical modeling. Each project is documented with its objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

Projects
1. Win Prediction Model for Competitive Gaming
Description: A Logistic Regression model designed to predict team wins in the competitive game Counter-Strike 2 with 78% predictive accuracy.
Key Features:
Utilized a dataset of 1,500 observations from Faceit’s API.
Built a scalable data pipeline to process raw match and player statistics.
Applied advanced data cleaning techniques for robust predictive modeling.
Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Requests, Time)

2. Diabetes Prediction Based on Health Indicators
Description: A linear regression model to predict diabetes risk based on A1C levels using data from rural African Americans in Virginia.
Key Features:
Preprocessed and imputed missing data using data wrangling techniques in R.
Validated model integrity with statistical diagnostic measures (e.g., Cook’s Distance, DFFITs, DFBETAs).
Tech Stack: R (Linear Regression, RStudio, Tidyverse)
