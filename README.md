# Portfolio-Pierce-Hentosh
Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository highlights some of the key data science and analytics projects I've worked on, showcasing my experience in Python, R, and statistical modeling. Each project is documented with its objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

Projects
1. Win Prediction Model for Competitive Gaming
Description: Designed and implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to forecast team wins in Counter-Strike 2. Achieved a predictive accuracy of 77% ± 0.92, after testing multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, neural net, and XGBoosted Trees. Extracted and processed a robust dataset of 9,651 observations from Faceit, an esports matchmaking service, API
Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Requests, Time, XGBoost, PyTorch)

2. Diabetes Prediction Based on Health Indicators
Description: A linear regression model to predict diabetes risk based on A1C levels using data from rural African Americans in Virginia.
Key Features:
Preprocessed and imputed missing data using data wrangling techniques in R.
Validated model integrity with statistical diagnostic measures (e.g., Cook’s Distance, DFFITs, DFBETAs).
Tech Stack: R (Linear Regression, RStudio, Tidyverse)

3. Expediting ICP-MS Data Processing
Description: A Python-based program that automates raw data processing for heavy metals ICP-MS testing results, saving 2 hours of daily work.
Key Features:
Designed using Pandas and Openpyxl libraries for efficient data handling.
Outputs standardized and cleaned data in Excel formats tailored to client requirements.
Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Openpyxl)
